				<h2>February<br>Scott Sampson</h2>
				<p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the 
				   Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the 
				   Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the 
				   ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number 
				   of countries in Africa.</p>
				
				<p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the 
				   University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned 
				   dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid 
				   horns and frills.</p>
